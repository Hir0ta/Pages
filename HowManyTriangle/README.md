# How many triangles

It walks through of the canvas horizontal half line by pixel! It devide the the x coordinate with 4:
- if the rest is 0, than it goes to (0,0);
- if the rest is 1,than it goes to (cw,0);
- if the rest is 2,than it goes to (0,ch);
- if the rest is 3,than it goes to (cw,ch);

After that it draws out some triangles,do you clever enought to count it all? ;-)
